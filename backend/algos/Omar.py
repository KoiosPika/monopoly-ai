    """
    Uses Temporal Difference (TD) Learning to decide whether the current player should pay rent

    using the TD(0) rule.


    Parameters:

            Fields:
                - name (str): Player's name (e.g., "Player 2")
                - avatar (str): Avatar image filename
                - balance (int): Current money the player has
                - position (int): Current board index (0â€“23)

                - inJail (bool): Whether the player is currently in jail
                - getOutOfJailCards (int): Number of jail-free cards the player holds

                - bankrupt (bool): Whether the player is bankrupt

        players (list of dict): A list containing all 4 players' state objects, each with the same fields as above.

        properties (list of dict): A list of all properties on the board.
            Fields:
                - name (str): Property name (e.g., "P3")
                - index (int): Board index of the property
                - price (int): Purchase cost
                - rent (int): Base rent amount

                - owner (str or None): Name of the player who owns it (or None)
                - mortgaged (bool): Whether the property is mortgaged
                - color (str): Color group of the property (e.g., "#FF69B4")
        rent (int): Rent amount to pay
        learning_rate (float): How quickly to update values (default: 0.1)
        discount (float): How much future states matter (default: 0.9)

    Returns:
        bool: True if the agent believes paying rent is better long-term; False to suggest mortgaging
